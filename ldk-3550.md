# Encapsulate Channel enum variants inside a struct [#3550](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3550)

Figure out what these now-renamed macros will do:
convert_chan_phase_err
break_channel_entry
try_chan_phase_entry
remove_channel_phase

chan_phase_entry -> chan_entry

All of these things used to be associated with ChannelPhase, where was
it removed?
- Commit wording is a little confusing, the prep commits say "now that
  channel phase has been renamed", but the rename actually happens
  after the first few commits.

Moved to only use methods on the channel rather than the underlying enum.
- Previously had to take entry out of hashmap and then re-add the 
  underlying channel held by the enum.
- Now can switch out the underlying enum, work on the channel and then
  replace the temporary placeholder.

How does the ChannelError::NotFound variant work?
- Want to send an error to the peer but _not_ close the channel.
- Initially thought that this could be a new `Close(ClosureReason)`,
  but the key difference is that we do not want to close. None of the
  other `ChannelError` variants provide this - they're warnings/ignores.
