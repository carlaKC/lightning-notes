# Give HTLCHandlingFailed a reason of some kind
https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3541

- [Previous PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2933)
  added more instances of `HTLCHandlingFailed`
- Nice to give the event a reason code to provide more information

Things I should figure out here:

Are there other events with reason fields?
- It's part of the events module's `Event` type which represents all
  the actions that a user would have to take action to address
- Some examples of other events with reasons:
  - `PaymentFailed` has `Option<PaymentFailureReason>`
    - This contains various explanations for the failure
    - It's an `Option<>` because it wasn't previously included
  - `ChannelClosed` has a `ClosureReason`:
    - Also various explanations of the channel closure
    - Not an option, assuming because it was always present

Where is `HTLCHandlingFailed` used?
- channelmanager / fail_htlc_backwards_internal_without_forward_event
  - fail_htlc_backwards_internal (all have HTLCFailReason b/c arg)
    - fail_intercepted_htlc (unknown next hop / has HTLCFailReason)
    - process_pending_htlc_forwards
    - timer_tick_occurred (mpp timeout / has HTLCFailReason)
    - fail_htlc_backwards_with_reason (var / has HTLCFailReason)
    - fail_holding_cell_htlcs (variable / has HTLCFailReason)
  - forward_htlcs_without_forward_event
    - forward_htlcs (invalid forward / has HTLCFailReason)
    - process_pending_update_add_htlcs (has HTLCFailReason)

A HTLCFailReason enum already exists? But it's the protocol one and it's
in a different crate to the events:
- Do we want a different enum in the events mod (maybe that direction
  of import is a no-go?)

Dependencies:
- HTLCFailReason is in `ln/onion_utils.rs`
  - We do import some events in 
- HTLCHandlingFailed is in `events/mod.rs`
  - We do import some `ln` types into `events` 
    (eg: channelmanager::PaymentID)

Are any of these "internal" imported types surfaced on the events
API? This is probably the more important question if the imports
work out.
- In `PaymentClaimable` we export `PaymentID` which belongs to
  `channelmanager`, likewise for `RecipientOnionFields`.
- They will need to be public, because they'll be used by calling code

Are the necessary fields public? Should we re-export them?
- Yup, these are just plain pub if they're exposed on the API.

How do we handle persistence for the new fields (look at another example).
- Look at `last_local_balance_msat` in `ChannelClosed`
- There are different macros used for different persisted items
  - In our read we have `_init_tiv_based_struct_field` for our type
    - What does that mean? It's for required TLVs that are upgraded
      without compat? I think this is fine based on the other fields
      I looked at.

After working on this for a bit, realized that a lot of what we have in
HTLCFailReason isn't really required for an end user.

Open questions:
- Should I instead implement `From` in `events`? Seems more canonical!
  - I can put these in the individual files and it's fine
  - Keep [this commit]([HTLCFailReasonRepr public](https://github.com/carlaKC/rust-lightning/pull/1/commits/39f6f0ce0be2acc042200abd44d00b3ac773cb77#diff-55a5701bd585fdeb4f451c4259c1c1e342a01fdc0c570a3f9c76ebac91fae02eR1241))
    to remember that putting it in the events dir means I have to make
    things public that we don't want to make public!
- Is it better to just expose public types? _Maybe_, but it's ugly

PR Description:
===============

This PR adds `HTLCHandlingFailure` to `HTLCHandlingFailed` to address #3541.

#### Implementation Rationale
A simpler version of this would be to make `HTLCFailReason` public and just surface that on the API. 
- Decided against [this approach]() because it exposes not-so-user-friendly types on the API with types like OnionErrorPacket`
- Happy to go with this if it's preferred!

## Review Round #1

There's already an enum `HTLCDestination` that has some additional
information about the paymnts failing - consider adding to this instead.

Go back to the call sites:
- process_pending_update_add_htlcs
  - htlc_fails is generated on the spot, using get_failed_htlc_destination
    - This is a closure that just sets failed_payment when we dont want it
    - We have the update add error on hand here so we can use that?
- fail_htlc_backwards_internal_without_forward_event
  - failed_intercept_forwards is generated on the spot
    - Just says `InvalidForward` w/ no reason (code: 0x4000 | 10)

Next thoughts is to have a constructor for `HTLCDestination` that will
add something to it. Do that!

Next up is to look at where we use `HTLCDestination`:
- Seems like the `FailedPayment` variant is the most likely to be
  helpful?
- Look again at where we add `HTLCDestination` via `HTLCHandlingFailure`:
  - `get_failed_htlc_destination` takes the outgoing scid and payment
    hash to create a failure:
    - Unkonwn next hop channel if we know the channel ID otherwise
      create a failed payment
  - We have the htlc failure code from `htlc_failure_from_update_add_err`
- `fail_bakcwards_internal_without_forward_event`
  - `fail_htlc_backwards_internal`
  - `forward_htlcs_without_forward_event`:
    - Only creates a `InvalidForward`: this seems to only have one type
      of event so not sure that it needs more detail?
      - 0x2000 | 2 = NODE / temporary node failure
      - 0x4000 | 10 = PERM / unknown next peer

Should also look at the PR referenced in the issue to see places where
we introduced the htlc handling failed calls?

get_failed_htlc_destination:
- If there is no `outgoing_scid` then it's a failed payment (to us)
- If there is an `outgoing_scid`:
  - UnknownNextHop if we don't know about the channel
  - Otherwise NextHopChannel

The destination is slightly different to the failure; for example we
could have a failure that has a next hop channel that's also got some
invalid stuff going on.

We already have a failure code enum which could be useful.

Q: For each of these call sites, is there more information available
than the error code?
-> Yes, there are a few cases where we have more information on the
  call site than the error code itself.
