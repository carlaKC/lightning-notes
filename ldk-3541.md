# Give HTLCHandlingFailed a reason of some kind
https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3541

- [Previous PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2933)
  added more instances of `HTLCHandlingFailed`
- Nice to give the event a reason code to provide more information

Things I should figure out here:

Are there other events with reason fields?
- It's part of the events module's `Event` type which represents all
  the actions that a user would have to take action to address
- Some examples of other events with reasons:
  - `PaymentFailed` has `Option<PaymentFailureReason>`
    - This contains various explanations for the failure
    - It's an `Option<>` because it wasn't previously included
  - `ChannelClosed` has a `ClosureReason`:
    - Also various explanations of the channel closure
    - Not an option, assuming because it was always present

Where is `HTLCHandlingFailed` used?
- channelmanager / fail_htlc_backwards_internal_without_forward_event
  - fail_htlc_backwards_internal (all have HTLCFailReason b/c arg)
    - fail_intercepted_htlc (unknown next hop / has HTLCFailReason)
    - process_pending_htlc_forwards
    - timer_tick_occurred (mpp timeout / has HTLCFailReason)
    - fail_htlc_backwards_with_reason (var / has HTLCFailReason)
    - fail_holding_cell_htlcs (variable / has HTLCFailReason)
  - forward_htlcs_without_forward_event
    - forward_htlcs (invalid forward / has HTLCFailReason)
    - process_pending_update_add_htlcs (has HTLCFailReason)

A HTLCFailReason enum already exists? But it's the protocol one and it's
in a different crate to the events:
- Do we want a different enum in the events mod (maybe that direction
  of import is a no-go?)

Dependencies:
- HTLCFailReason is in `ln/onion_utils.rs`
  - We do import some events in 
- HTLCHandlingFailed is in `events/mod.rs`
  - We do import some `ln` types into `events` 
    (eg: channelmanager::PaymentID)

Are any of these "internal" imported types surfaced on the events
API? This is probably the more important question if the imports
work out.
- In `PaymentClaimable` we export `PaymentID` which belongs to
  `channelmanager`, likewise for `RecipientOnionFields`.
- They will need to be public, because they'll be used by calling code

Are the necessary fields public? Should we re-export them?
- Yup, these are just plain pub if they're exposed on the API.

How do we handle persistence for the new fields (look at another example).
- Look at `last_local_balance_msat` in `ChannelClosed`
- There are different macros used for different persisted items
  - In our read we have `_init_tiv_based_struct_field` for our type
    - What does that mean? It's for required TLVs that are upgraded
      without compat? I think this is fine based on the other fields
      I looked at.

After working on this for a bit, realized that a lot of what we have in
HTLCFailReason isn't really required for an end user.

Open questions:
- Should I instead implement `From` in `events`? Seems more canonical!
  - I can put these in the individual files and it's fine
  - Keep [this commit]([HTLCFailReasonRepr public](https://github.com/carlaKC/rust-lightning/pull/1/commits/39f6f0ce0be2acc042200abd44d00b3ac773cb77#diff-55a5701bd585fdeb4f451c4259c1c1e342a01fdc0c570a3f9c76ebac91fae02eR1241))
    to remember that putting it in the events dir means I have to make
    things public that we don't want to make public!
- Is it better to just expose public types? _Maybe_, but it's ugly

PR Description:
===============

This PR adds `HTLCHandlingFailure` to `HTLCHandlingFailed` to address #3541.

#### Implementation Rationale
A simpler version of this would be to make `HTLCFailReason` public and just surface that on the API. 
- Decided against [this approach]() because it exposes not-so-user-friendly types on the API with types like OnionErrorPacket`
- Happy to go with this if it's preferred!

## Review Round #1

There's already an enum `HTLCDestination` that has some additional
information about the paymnts failing - consider adding to this instead.

Go back to the call sites:
- process_pending_update_add_htlcs
  - htlc_fails is generated on the spot, using get_failed_htlc_destination
    - This is a closure that just sets failed_payment when we dont want it
    - We have the update add error on hand here so we can use that?
- fail_htlc_backwards_internal_without_forward_event
  - failed_intercept_forwards is generated on the spot
    - Just says `InvalidForward` w/ no reason (code: 0x4000 | 10)

Next thoughts is to have a constructor for `HTLCDestination` that will
add something to it. Do that!
