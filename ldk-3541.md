# Give HTLCHandlingFailed a reason of some kind
https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3541

- [Previous PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2933)
  added more instances of `HTLCHandlingFailed`
- Nice to give the event a reason code to provide more information

Things I should figure out here:

Are there other events with reason fields?
- It's part of the events module's `Event` type which represents all
  the actions that a user would have to take action to address
- Some examples of other events with reasons:
  - `PaymentFailed` has `Option<PaymentFailureReason>`
    - This contains various explanations for the failure
    - It's an `Option<>` because it wasn't previously included
  - `ChannelClosed` has a `ClosureReason`:
    - Also various explanations of the channel closure
    - Not an option, assuming because it was always present

Where is `HTLCHandlingFailed` used?
- channelmanager / fail_htlc_backwards_internal_without_forward_event
  - fail_htlc_backwards_internal (all have HTLCFailReason b/c arg)
    - fail_intercepted_htlc (unknown next hop / has HTLCFailReason)
    - process_pending_htlc_forwards
    - timer_tick_occurred (mpp timeout / has HTLCFailReason)
    - fail_htlc_backwards_with_reason (var / has HTLCFailReason)
    - fail_holding_cell_htlcs (variable / has HTLCFailReason)
  - forward_htlcs_without_forward_event
    - forward_htlcs (invalid forward / has HTLCFailReason)
    - process_pending_update_add_htlcs (has HTLCFailReason)

A HTLCFailReason enum already exists? But it's the protocol one and it's
in a different crate to the events:
- Do we want a different enum in the events mod (maybe that direction
  of import is a no-go?)

Dependencies:
- HTLCFailReason is in `ln/onion_utils.rs`
  - We do import some events in 
- HTLCHandlingFailed is in `events/mod.rs`
  - We do import some `ln` types into `events` 
    (eg: channelmanager::PaymentID)

Are any of these "internal" imported types surfaced on the events
API? This is probably the more important question if the imports
work out.
- In `PaymentClaimable` we export `PaymentID` which belongs to
  `channelmanager`, likewise for `RecipientOnionFields`.
- They will need to be public, because they'll be used by calling code

Are the necessary fields public? Should we re-export them?
- Yup, these are just plain pub if they're exposed on the API.

How do we handle persistence for the new fields (look at another example).
- Look at `last_local_balance_msat` in `ChannelClosed`
- There are different macros used for different persisted items
  - In our read we have `_init_tiv_based_struct_field` for our type
    - What does that mean? It's for required TLVs that are upgraded
      without compat? I think this is fine based on the other fields
      I looked at.

After working on this for a bit, realized that a lot of what we have in
HTLCFailReason isn't really required for an end user.

Open questions:
- Should I instead implement `From` in `events`? Seems more canonical!
  - I can put these in the individual files and it's fine
  - Keep [this commit]([HTLCFailReasonRepr public](https://github.com/carlaKC/rust-lightning/pull/1/commits/39f6f0ce0be2acc042200abd44d00b3ac773cb77#diff-55a5701bd585fdeb4f451c4259c1c1e342a01fdc0c570a3f9c76ebac91fae02eR1241))
    to remember that putting it in the events dir means I have to make
    things public that we don't want to make public!
- Is it better to just expose public types? _Maybe_, but it's ugly

PR Description:
===============

This PR adds `HTLCHandlingFailure` to `HTLCHandlingFailed` to address #3541.

#### Implementation Rationale
A simpler version of this would be to make `HTLCFailReason` public and just surface that on the API. 
- Decided against [this approach]() because it exposes not-so-user-friendly types on the API with types like OnionErrorPacket`
- Happy to go with this if it's preferred!

## Review Round #1

There's already an enum `HTLCDestination` that has some additional
information about the paymnts failing - consider adding to this instead.

Go back to the call sites:
- process_pending_update_add_htlcs
  - htlc_fails is generated on the spot, using get_failed_htlc_destination
    - This is a closure that just sets failed_payment when we dont want it
    - We have the update add error on hand here so we can use that?
- fail_htlc_backwards_internal_without_forward_event
  - failed_intercept_forwards is generated on the spot
    - Just says `InvalidForward` w/ no reason (code: 0x4000 | 10)

Next thoughts is to have a constructor for `HTLCDestination` that will
add something to it. Do that!

Next up is to look at where we use `HTLCDestination`:
- Seems like the `FailedPayment` variant is the most likely to be
  helpful?
- Look again at where we add `HTLCDestination` via `HTLCHandlingFailure`:
  - `get_failed_htlc_destination` takes the outgoing scid and payment
    hash to create a failure:
    - Unkonwn next hop channel if we know the channel ID otherwise
      create a failed payment
  - We have the htlc failure code from `htlc_failure_from_update_add_err`
- `fail_bakcwards_internal_without_forward_event`
  - `fail_htlc_backwards_internal`
  - `forward_htlcs_without_forward_event`:
    - Only creates a `InvalidForward`: this seems to only have one type
      of event so not sure that it needs more detail?
      - 0x2000 | 2 = NODE / temporary node failure
      - 0x4000 | 10 = PERM / unknown next peer

Should also look at the PR referenced in the issue to see places where
we introduced the htlc handling failed calls?

get_failed_htlc_destination:
- If there is no `outgoing_scid` then it's a failed payment (to us)
- If there is an `outgoing_scid`:
  - UnknownNextHop if we don't know about the channel
  - Otherwise NextHopChannel

The destination is slightly different to the failure; for example we
could have a failure that has a next hop channel that's also got some
invalid stuff going on.

Q: For each of these call sites, is there more information available
than the error code?
-> Yes, there are a few cases where we have more information on the
  call site than the error code itself.


Q: Where is it interesting to have a more descriptive error code?

(1)

The places that are interesting are:
- `process_pending_update_add_htlcs` / `can_accept_incoming_htlc` (dust exposure)
- `process_pending_update_add_htlcs` / `can_forward_htlc` / `can_forward_htlc_to_outgoing_channel` (private channel)

The places that are less interesting are:
- `can_forward_htlc` / `check_incoming_htlc_cltv` (exact mapping)
- `construct_pending_htlc_status` / `create_recv_pending_htlc_info` (route blinding, mostly)
- `construct_pending_htlc_status` / `create_recv_pending_htlc_info` (route blinding)

(2)

The places that are interesting are:
- `forward_htlcs` (intercept duplicate)
- `forward_htlcs_without_forward_event` (duplicate intercept)
- `fail_htlc_backwards_internal` / `fail_intercepted_htlc` (user failed intercept)
- `fail_htlc_backwards_internal` / `process_pending_htlc_forwards` (keysend dup)
- `fail_htlc_backwards_internal` / `do_chain_event` / `claimable_payments` (expiry too close)
- `fail_htlc_backwards_internal` / `do_chain_event` / `pending_intercepted_htlcs` (too close to expiry)

The places that are less interesting are:
- `fail_htlc_backwards_internal` / `close_channel_internal` (local channel close)
- `fail_htlc_backwards_internal` / `finish_close_channel` (exact mapping)
- `fail_htlc_backwards_internal` / `timer_tick_occurred` (exact mapping)
- `fail_htlc_backwards_internal` / `fail_htlc_backwards_with_reason` (exact mapping)
- `fail_htlc_backwards_internal` / `claim_payment_internal` (bad TLVs)
- `fail_htlc_backwards_internal` / `internal_shutdown` (shutdown received) 
- `fail_htlc_backwards_internal` / `do_chain_event` (exact mapping)
- `fail_htlc_backwards_internal` / `read` (exact mapping)

Q: What's a reasonable way to handle this refactor?
- Add an emum which has the existing specification error codes
- This implements a mapping to the actual error code when we need it
- Pass these back, and then surface them on the API eventually 

Steps for this:
- Instead of returning a u16, return an enum
- Add more variants and mapping in next step
- Surface on API

Problem?
- Where do we draw the line between onion error code (u16) and this new
  enum?
- Should we use it _everwhere_ or only when we're pushing an event
  to external?

Q: Does it make sense to add this to `HTLCDestination`?
- No, these are sort of orthogonal things 

Q: Does it make sense to add this to `HTLCFailReason` as a new variant?
- Maybe not for surfacing things on the API, but could make sense
  to keep it in the onion package because it's mapping to onion errors

Can possibly also remove the static string that's being passed around

Can also create a `HTLCFailReason` from this new enum, which will
keep the mapping in the same "realm" of the onion structure, or sub out
the u16 in the `Reason` variant with a more detailed approach?
-> Let's try this one!
-> Persistence gets quite tricky! Replacing the u16 with an enum is
  ugly

Assume that we're going to replace the str + u16 combo, what's the best
way to do it?
- `can_accept_incoming_htlc`:
  - Return: enum describing issue
  - Usage:
    - `htlc_failure_from_update_add_err`: accepts param, maps to err code
    - push event with more detailed info
- `can_forward_htlc_to_outgoing_channel`:
  - Return: enum describing issue
  - Usage:
    - `htlc_failure_from_update_add_err`: accepts param, maps to err code
    - push event with more detailed info
- `forward_htlcs`:
  - Return: creates and uses enum on the spot
  - Usage:
    - `fail_backwards_internal_without_forward_event` takes new enum

It would be really nice to be able to keep this all in `HTLCFailReason`
- Return enum from function that covers all errors and others
- Maps to either spec error code or other (which helps with persistence)
- This can't overlap with the faliure codes, because then we can have
  the wrong type?

Chatted to Matt:
- We don't really care about things like route blinding
- Also probably don't want _all_ of the bolt failures surfaced

One thing that I don't like is using this in `onion_payment`, doesn't
seem like the correct home for using this enum?
-> Start with this and see how it goes

Q: Can this be combined with `HTLCFailReason`?
- Passing both around is redundant in some cases, would be good to
  be able to have the failure reason + optional enrichment data if
  required

Approach:
- For now including it as an optional additional field in the `HTLCFailReason`
  and will figure out the best way to serialize it later.
- Just replace all error codes with the enum then simplify accordingly

I have tried various approaches and none of them really seem right.
The problem is:
- Some of

Of all of the reasons we have to make things uniform:
	DustLimitHolder,
	DustLimitCounterparty,
	FeeSpikeBuffer,
	ShutdownSent,
	PrivateChannelForward,
	RealSCIDForward,
	x ChannelDisabled,
	ChannelNotReady,
	x ChannelClosed,
	InterceptFailed,
	DupliateIntercept,
	x HTLCTimeout,
	x AmountBelowMinimum,
	x UnknownChannel,
	x IncorrectCLTVExpiry,
	x CLTVExpiryTooClose,
	x CLTVExpiryTooFar,
	x InsufficientFee,

What are all the options:
1. Internal: Define all of the BOLT04 error codes + extra reasons in an
   enum, refactor everywhere to use them,
   API: re-map BOLT04 messages to something useful
   -> Downside: have to painstakingly re-map every one of the BOLT04
      codes, large refactor (and need to re-map them anywaye
2. Internal: Only define "extra" reasons in enum, leave BOLT04 as u16
   API: Re-use the extra reasons enum as is and re-map BOLT04 to enum
   -> Downside: could just be sending BOLT04 code when there's actually
      a better reason to be given

Another option would to to pair this error with the HTLC destination
and leave the reason alone? This would help to de-duplicate some of the
errors which map directly to the destination fields (such as InvalidOnion).

Q: can we cleanly pair failures with HTLC destination?

Where would we want additional information?
- NextHopChannel
  - get_failed_htlc_destination: reason not right there
  - process_pending_htlc_forwards: reason right there

- FailedPayment
  - get_failed_htlc_destination: reason not right there, check usage
  - fail_htlc_backwards_with_reason, also not right there

handle_monitor_update_completion -> (error is in updates.failed_htlcs)

It _seems_ like we could attach this to the HTLC destination that we're
interested in adding some information around, and get around the duplicate
info that we have in errors and reasons?

- Still use the enum with u16 and reasons, but define any error that
  we want to be able to provide the end user (even if it's just B12)
- What about when it's more specific than we want for the user?
  - eg, we have three different failure codes and they're all the same
    for an end user?
    - We can't use that in the codebase -> this is where we need a mapping
      which has *both the u16 and the user friendly code*

Where is this actually better than what I have now?
- There isn't redundant information in HTLCDestination
- We don't have to do re-mapping of different values
- Can map B04 -> fewer error codes, can't map fewer error codes -> B04

Need to pick one way and do it, then can look at other options.

Take two! What have I learned from the first approach?
- Converting to a user-friendly error code is a massive mare, seems
  like it'll be better to just define these once and pass them through
- We're erasing in two directions:
  - B04 erasure: we're getting rid of privacy leaking stuff
  - User erasure: we're getting rid of complicated info that an end
    user probably doesn't want
  -> SO, we should store both pieces of infomration and it's okay if
    they are duplicates; this saves us a conversion later on
- Need to get a better sense of what's going on at the callsites

process_pending_update_add_htlcs:
- This is where we do a lot of interesting calls like `can_accept_incoming_htlc`
  and get some codes that are interesting for the user
- We use `get_failed_htlc_destination` to create the dest
  - We can pass that info in to get more info

Can we still use the enum that I had?
- B04 erasure: can track 
- User erasure: still need to track the actual failure code
  - Otherwise have a failure detail which doesn't have the specifically
    correct enum

Q: is this the correct place to be doing this type of error mapping?
- Doesn't feel right to be doing the user-side erasure here
- Just return the enum, and map the destination to the error code?
  - This is the same problem! But we do get rid of the unnecesary info
    being duplicated; only including the few enums that are useful

fail_htlc_backwards_internal_without_forward_event:
- This callsite has HTLCDestination passed in from various sources
- Going to check by trying to add a u16 to them and then extending with
  more information

If this works then I can go ahead with two-way erasure failure codes?


*This is independent of whether things end up going in HTLCDestination*
Struct:
- Allows 2-way mapping for failure codes <> BOLT04
  Downside: if there's a BOLT04 that's surfaced you have both values
    Mitigation: you can force use of a new fn to make sure these are
    always ok!
  Upside: no mapping of annoying BOLT04 values to user codes (done in place)
  and can handle BOLT04 erasure
-> Keep going with this one!

Enum:
- Allows 1-way unerasure of B04 to user codes, does not allow erasing
  B04 codes because we need them in place (would have to create moar
  enum options)
  Downside: have to do mapping on API
  Upside: less repeated information

  Different design params:
  - Error communication: struct vs enum
  - Propagation: Destination vs Failure

  It seems like `HTLCDestination` is already just an end-user struct,
  so it seems okay to chuck some things in there.

Focus: See whether adding to HTLC destination works inside of daunting
macro!

handle_monitor_update_completion:
- updates.failed_htlcs provides information about the failure
- these come from monitor_updating_restored's failed_htlcs
  - these come from monitor_pending_failures
    - set in monitor_updating_paused (via HTLCFailReason) 

SO!
- Create the reason in HTLCFailureReason
- Generate the Destination from the HTLCFailureReason so that we can
  always assert on the types used?

This allows us to use the transport of the HTLCFailureReason along with
the user-facing element of the HTLCDestination

Chatted to Val: just cart around the real thing and don't worry about
it too much, use one big enum that can be re-surfaced on the API.

First: focus on carting these around everywhere we need them
- the handle monitor stuff just has a HTLCFailReason
- would need to update OutboungHTLCOutcome to fix
- These are actually just failure reasons that came from the upstream
  and we just have the bolt04 failure code anyway
  - But what do we do here?

Are these always HTLCs that were failed upstream? Yes I think so!

Things like create_recv_pending_htlc_info have inbound htlc error
messages which don't provide the correct level of information;
-> Should the Inbound HTLC error itself be changed?

Is it the case that we should always have a reason present when we
are locally failing but not when we are remotely failing? This seems
too complicated

another possibility:
- keep all the u16s as they are
- have a Some(extra info) avilable
- validate that we don't create them with redundant information
- just map them last-minute to the B04 translations

Can we use the enum if we're doing this last minute mapping? Provided
that each enum member only maps to one value

FINAL APPROACH / MUST PUSH

- Include these reasons in `HTLCDestination` so that we don't 
  duplicate things like `InvalidOnion` which are already represented
- Define one big enum which has both additional information and the
  directly mapped BOLT04 reasons
  - Create with an constructor which will:
    - Assert that the failure code and the reason match
    - Assert that directly-mapped enum B04 values aren't used
      - In this case we should just use a failure code
 - Move things around in an enum that has a code or a enum value:
   - These can also provide error strings
   - The enum can then be mapped into() the big enum
     ? Maybe this is mapping directly into a HTLCDestination so that
       we can make sure that there's no duplicate. This is stretch.
     - Unwrap the variant that just has the extra reason
     - Map the variant that has the B04 value

I think I'm going to have to put it in HTLCFailReason because that's
what's propagated through?

Cutoff - Must push today:
=========================
Two things I need to confirm:
- What fail_hodling_cells does
- Whether the downstream error is correct

Instead of doing an ugly mapping, let's just surface every BOLT04 code
that could possibly be interesting and then be beat back from there.

get_pending_htlc_into
- Matches to the type of receive we've going to have
- We then create a destination from it (based entirely on next channel)
- The problem is that we could get a next hop channel which has a 
  failure_code set, and then we won't have a reason

Perhaps we just surface FailureDetails as they are?
- We give a lot of enums in our defined local failure
- Everything else is surfaced in a FaliureCode (might as well have it)
- This way we don't really run into annoying issues about having the
  right information; we've always got it around


Need to confirm:
- Is it a downstream failure?
  - The things that end up in handle_mointor_completion are HTLCs
    that are failed by `revoke_and_ack`; these may include our own
    payments (afaik), so these aren't _just_ downstream failures.
- This goes on to call fail_backwards_internal, which will push the
  destination that we've provided? It says it's a nexthopchannel so
  I _think_ it's okay?
 
- What about free_holding_cells?
DO THIS BEFORE PUSH

Pushing[*] for a conceptual look because I haven't found a way of doing
this that I'm _super_ happy with. Specifically interested in thoughts
on:
- Reason in `HTLCDestination`: already contains information about the
  failure, so including a `reason` in `HTLCHandlingFailed` would be
  repetitive for cases like `UnknownNextHop`.
- Still surfacing a B04 error code: an alternative approach would be
  to map all these codes that we don't really care about to another
  user-friendly enum that summarizes them (eg, `InvalidPayload` covering
  blinding/hmac/etc) [**]. Combining the two gets a bit ugly, and I think
  that it's reasonably usable to have the human readable value for most
  common errors and fall back to the code for the more obscure/detailed
  ones.

If this looks okay, I'll go ahead and clean up tests+docs and add a
similar for `HTLCDestination::FailedPayment`!

[*] Force pushed because this is a different approach; old version that 
just surfaces B04 failure codes is [here](https://github.com/carlaKC/rust-lightning/commit/4a14debd60647a8ed163aaa43fddc230dde871d6).
[**] We can't put them in `LocalHTLCFailureReason` because they erase the
actual B04 code, so we'd need to track the summary error and the B04
code together (which is doable, but ugly to have API-facing values being
carted around internally).

++++
PLUS: ask why fail_holding_cells doesn't use UnkonwnNExtHop when we can't
find the channel in our map

Just pushed it asking for feedback, even though I'm not ready ready;
MUST investigate:
- Can we get local failures in `monitor_update`
- What `free_holding_cells` is actually doing

Second approach: 3541-approach-reasonandcode

Feedback: Matt actually does just want one masive enum

Problem: we get a u16 when we get our malformed error and we can't
map it exactly (onion_payment);

Questions for Val:
- Migrating existing u16 enum filed?
- What to do with from-the-wire messages
- fail_holding_cell_htlcs (our htlcs and theirs?)

Issues:

internal_update_fail_malformed_htlc
- This is called when we get a malformed HTLC from our upstream
  peer; need to be able to transform a u16 to something else?
-> What if the error doesn't match our error code

Take alook at impl_writeable_tlv_based for ChannelDetails


Old field:

But allows nasty stuff?

## Legacy Migration

impl_writeable_tlv_based has a legacy option which allows migrating
fields:

- The legacy field has (legacy, type, closure) where the closure
  acts on the struct and returns the old field if it's present
- The new field doesn't have a number, it has `_unused` and `static_value`,
  and can access the old fields if it needs them

Taking a look at how this works:
- The legacy fields are serialized as optional (even though they might
  not have been previously?)
- Read is the more interesting impl:
  - Both old fields are options
  - New field is read from the old fields if they're present

We implement `Readable` for the `st` struct:
- call `_decode_and_build` with the reader, Self and type/field/fieldtype
- `_init_and_read_len_prefixed_tlv_fields`: reads the TLVs
  - This does need to take the `fieldty` so that it knows whether it
    is an option/required/legacy
    - `init_tlv_field_var`:
      - matches on the `fieldty` so that it knows how to go about
        the reading
      - if it's a legcy field, it'll re-call with `init_tlv_field_var`
        as an option (this is how we allow it to no longer be present)
  - `read_tlv_fields` will then read the fields from disk with these
    set field types
- `drop_legacy_field_definition`
  - requires a struct type
  - Runs through fields on the struct and only pushes them to the
    struct if they're not legacy, which will remove them

How is this done for `impl_writeable_tlv_based_enum`?
- Writing: `_impl_writeable_tlv_based_enum`:
  - 
- Reading: `decode_and_build` (which won't allow writing)

Checking what's wrong with my attempt:
```
impl_writeable_tlv_based_enum!(HTLCFailReasonRepr,
	(0, LightningError) => {
		(0, err, required),
	},
	(1, Reason) => {
		(0, _failure_code, (legacy, u16,
			|us: &HTLCFailReasonRepr| Some(us.clone()) )),
		(_unused, reason, (static_value,
			if let Some(code) = _failure_code {
				code.into()
			} else {
				reason
			}
		)),
		(2, data, required_vec),
	},
);

```

What's happening?
- If we have the legacy field, we're fine
- If we don't have the legacy field, we are using an uninitialized value
  for reason rather than picking our own value?

What do we want to happen:
- If the legacy value is set => use it
- If the legacy value is not set => use new value

What doesn't the compiler know?
- I know that if `failure_code` is not set, then we'll always have
  a `reason` on hand to write; if `failure_code` is set, then we won't
  have `reason` on hand

Reading a legacy verion:
failure_code = 10;
data= [a, b, c];

Reading a new version:
reason = 10;
data= [a, b, c];

- It's not actually reading out the value in `reason`
  - Setting to required means it'll be read (but is required to be there)
  - Using default values works! When we don't have a value, we use
    the old one

Writing a new version:
reason = 10;
data = [a, b, c];
