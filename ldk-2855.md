# HTLC Interception

## Issue Writeup

https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2855

- LDK currently has the ability to intercept HTLCs that have "magic"
  SCID values (which belong to phantom payments), it would also
  be good to just provide regular interception.
- 

Related issues:
- https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2320: reject
  HTLCs if running low on funds.
- https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2425: ability
  to add reputation algorithm.
  - Matt [notes](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2425#issuecomment-1639046677)
    that we don't really want this handled via events (which users
    have to handle).
  - [Rather](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2425#issuecomment-1648757397)
    it should be its own trait with sane defaults.
  - If the DOS-limiter allows a HTLC, it should still allow a
    [PendingHTLCsForwardable](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2425#issuecomment-1684225186) event to be processed.
- https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2839:
  provides the option to externally provide a preimage for interception

## Draft PR

https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3843

There is a draft PR up that starts to address this issue. It needs
rebase and has been stale since 13 June. Some relevant points to
consider:
- [Concern](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3843#issuecomment-2967983465)
  that a handler can block hot paths in LDK. Noted that the events
  approach could help with this.
- [Callback](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3843#pullrequestreview-2924773696)
  to decide what to do with a HTLC later on seem to be required, no
  matter what approach is used.
- Suggestion to instead have a "do we want to intercept this"
  trait, and then use the existing interception logic.

## Existing Interception Logic

- There is a `HTLCIntercepted` event:
  - Currently generated for scids that are set using routing hints
  - Must be resolved with `forward_intercepted_htlc` or
    `fail_intercepted_htlc`
  - Also need to set `accept_intercept_htlcs` in your config to get
    these.
  - Contains the payment hash, next hop, inbound/outbound amount

Event creation:
- `forward_htlcs`:
  - Drain all pending forwards
  - If not our SCID 
  - We generate an interception ID
  - We add the HTLC to our pending intercepts

HTLC Forward:
- Get the alias of the peer that the outgoing channel belongs to
- Remove the HTLC from `pending_intercepted_htlcs`
- Create a HTLC to forward
- Individually call `forward_htlcs` with that single HTLC that we've
  freed

HTLC Fail:
- Gets the HTLC out of `pending_intercepted_htlcs`
- `fail_htlc_backwards_internal`
  - This is always called with `UnknownNextPeer`

## Re-Use of Interception for Jamming
[ ] Could add a `should_intercept_htlc` trait in front of where we
    add the interception event:
    Q: What if it's also a SCID intercept?
    Q: How do we handle errors here?
    Q: How do we think about blocking?
    Q: Would it cause a problem to be calling `forward_htlcs` on every
       single htlc when we call `forward_intercepted_htlc`? If we did
       general interception on every htlc, that could get heavy?
[ ] Would need to provide a different reason to failing in
    `fail_intercepted_htlc`
[ ] Doesn't have the expiry height of the HTLC.

## Designing a new interface

- Based on [this comment](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2425#issuecomment-1684225186), it seems like the desire is to have a trait that would
implement DOS protections in LDK (independent of the interceptor).
- There's some need for a htlc interceptor to [block](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3843#issuecomment-2963076191), which can be problematic for
  interception APIs.
- Callback architecture allows [not blocking the forwarding flow](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3843#issuecomment-2969244910).
- Could also have a [should we intercept this](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3843#pullrequestreview-2924773696) API?

Q: how would a DOS protection API work in combination with a general
   interception API?
- We do the DOS interception and *then* allow it to be piped into the
  same

Q: are we okay with this (possibly) being blocking?
- Probably not. Even though this is _super serious_ DOS stuff, it's
  still code that somebody else will be writing and plugging into LDK
  that could really muck our lives up if it's buggy.

What do we need to have?
- Add HTLC, get forward outcome / signal for it
- Remove htlc

### Approach 1 - Inline handling

This approach:
*  \+ Simple, easy to understand + implement
*  \- If code blocks, it can block all of LDK

- `forward_htlcs`:
  - Before we check whether we `should_hold_htlc`
  - Call trait inline `self.limit_resources(pending_add)`
  - If drop HTLC:
    - `fail_intercepted_htlc`
  - Else:
    - Push htlc to `forward_htlcs`, adding signal to `HTLCForwardInfo::AddHTLC`
    - `internal_process_pending_htlcs_forwards`
      - If it is a forward:
        - `process_forward_htlcs`
          - `queue_add_htlc`: this is when we actually hand off to the
            channel

Q: do we want interception to be before/after DOS checks? might want to override?
Before:
*  \+ We don't have to bother interception API with htlcs that we're going
    to drop anyway
*  \- We're going to DOS handle a bunch of HTLCs that are actually phantom

After:
*  \+ We only need to worry about HTLCs that we are actually going to
    forward
*  \- We might drop HTLCs that a generic interception API would want us
    to forward (eg, a LSP forwarding to a new channel), but if
    implementing a generic version of this maybe we can take that into
    account?

[ ] ^ This seems like an important decision to be made either way

Q: how do JIT channels interact with LDK?
Q: what happens to intercepted HTLCs if they're held too long?
Q: is `forward_htlcs` the right place to process? It includes receives
Q: is it okay to use `fail_intercepted_htlc` for non-intercepted htlcs?

### Approach 2 - Mimic interception api with trait

- `forward_htlcs`
