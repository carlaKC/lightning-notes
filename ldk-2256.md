# Attributable Failures

Reading HTLCs in `channel.rs`:
- We store two pieces of information in the channel:
  - removed_htlc_failure_attribution_data
  - holding_cell_failure_attribution_data

Why can't these be stored with whatever struct they belong with?
- Because we don't write our `InboundHTLCRemovalReason` as a TLV, it's
  just written as straight bytes so we can't extend them
- We're writing all of our `pending_inbound_htlcs`, and that includes
  our failure reasons
- Just write 1/2/3 for the type of the HTLC and then 1 / 2 / 3 for the
  failure types (so there's a fixed number of bytes that we expect
  once we've read these type prefixes - can't add anything).

Writing:
- We run through all of our HTLCs and push the data array to a vec
  of vecs if it's present, `None` otherwise
- This is then written like a regular TLV for the struct

Reading:
- We read the `Vec` of `Option<Vec>` out as a usual TLV
- If we got a `Vec` of `Option<Vec` read out:
  - We run through our pending inbound htlcs and filter out all
    entries that aren't `FailRelay` (since they don't need data
    supplemented)
  - We then go through our `Vec<Option<Vec>>` set the data on the
    `pending_inbound_htlcs` that are `FailRelay` types to fill the
    data back in

Thought that this could be a macro, but it doesn't really save may LOC:
```
		macro_rules! process_attribution_data {
				($attr_data:expr, $htlcs:expr, $ty:pat, $field:expr) => {
					if let Some(attribution_data_list) = $attr_data {
					let mut failures = $htlcs.iter_mut().filter_map(|item| {
					if let $ty {
						$field
					} else {
						None,
					}
					match item {
						$ty => Some($field),
						_ => None,
					}
				});

				for attribution_data in attribution_data_list {
					*failures.next().ok_or(DecodeError::InvalidValue)? = attribution_data;
				}

				if failures.next().is_some() {
					return Err(DecodeError::InvalidValue);
				}
			}
			};
		}
		process_attribution_data!(
			removed_htlc_failure_attribution_data,
			pending_inbound_htlcs,
			InboundHTLCState::LocalRemoved(InboundHTLCRemovalReason::FailRelay(ref mut packet)) = &mut status.state,
			&mut packet.attribution_data
		);

		process_attribution_data!(
			holding_cell_failure_attribution_data,
			holding_cell_htlc_updates,
			HTLCUpdateAwaitingACK::FailHTLC {
				err_packet: OnionErrorPacket { ref mut attribution_data, .. }, ..
			} = upd ,
			attribution_data
		);
```

Q: Is it okay to use an even value in `impl_writable_tlv_based_enum`
for an optional field? 

- Didn't check this but seems like not?
