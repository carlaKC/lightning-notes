# Resource Manager Impl

## Review Round 1

### Add DecayingAverage to resource manager

- Test coverage is good, all green on codecov.
- [ ] We should perhaps provide a few more "less obvious" hardcoded
  values to test decying averages (and provide them in the spec?).

### Add RevenueAverage to resource manager

- Naming is very application specific
- Needs some docs

### Add GeneralBucket to resource manager

- Why would we ever have none salt/
- Single source of truth for htlcs: saves us double-writing, downside
  is that we have to access at indices (which is yuk outtabounds yuk)
  - Do this in a defensive way then it's fine.
- [ ] Haven't reviewed tests in this commit because I think impl might
  change a little

### Add BucketResources to resource manager

- Straightforward impl
- Coverage? gg

### Add Channel to resource manager

- Do we need to have the incoming_channel on pending htlc
- [ ] `sufficient_reputation` seems like a slightly odd abstraction?
- [ ] There are a few coverage gaps that could be filled

### Add ResourceManager trait

- [x] Check mutex type in later commits
- Do we only remove a htlc if we were told to forward it? Yes.
  -> Make the doc here a little clearer.

### ResourceManager trait impl

- [ ] I have some general feeling that we should be handling different
  "levels" of errors differently. Like we removed a channel that's not
  there.

### Impl write and read for resource_manager

- Don't always need read args
- Why can we just write the unlocked hashmap but the read needs
  other actions
