# Make Channel Type Required

Implementing spec proposal to assume channel type:
https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1232

Open Channel / Open Channel V2:
- [x] Sender MUST set channel type (already always done)
  `new_for_outbound_channel`
    Always sets channel type
- [x] Receiver MUST fail the channel if not set (already always done)
  `new_for_inbound_channel`
    `channel_type_from_open_channel`
      - Fails if not set

Accept Channel:
- [ ] Sender MUST set channel type
  `generate_accept_channel_message`
    Always sets channel_type
- [ ] Receiver MUST fail if not == Open Channel
  `do_accept_channel_checks`

- [ ] Make feature bit required (not really specified in the spec PR afaik)
  `provided_init_features`

Q: Weird that LDK didn't previously enforce that the `channel_type`
  that we get in `accept_channel` matches when the feature is
  negotiated?
  - This is in the specification, so we should have been doing this all
    along

Fuzzer changes:

Hex Changes Explained

1. Init message feature bits (lines 9, 18, 50, 59):

The change is in the feature bits field: aaa208aa2a0a9aaa → aaa218aa2a0a9aaa
- Each two chars are the hex representation of a byte of feature info
- Each byte contains 8 bits used to mark our features
- This is just a vector, and the LSB is zero, next most significant is
  one etc.

aa = bits 56-63
a2 = bits 48-55
18 = bits 40-47
aa = bits 32-39
2a = bits 24-31
0a = bits 16-23
9a = bits 8-15
aa = bits 0-7

Bits 40-47 changed from 08 to 18: 00001000 → 00011000


2. Accept channel message length (lines 29-30):
- ext_from_hex("0112 01000000000000000000000000000000", &mut test);
+ ext_from_hex("0116 01000000000000000000000000000000", &mut test);

- Change: 0112 → 0116 (message length header)
- Meaning: Message length increased from 274 bytes (0x0112) to 278 bytes (0x0116)
- Reason: Adding 4 bytes for the required channel_type field

3. Accept channel read length (lines 36-37):
- ext_from_hex("030123", &mut test);
+ ext_from_hex("030127", &mut test);

- Change: 23 → 27 (35 → 39 bytes)
- Meaning: Reading 4 more bytes to accommodate the channel_type field

4. Accept channel message payload (lines 41-42):
- "0000000000000000000000000000000000 0000 01000000000000000000000000000000"
+ "0000000000000000000000000000000000 0000 01021000
01000000000000000000000000000000"

- Added: 01021000 (4 bytes)
- TLV format: 01 = TLV type 1 (channel_type), 02 = length 2 bytes, 1000 = channel
type value
  - Channel type: 1000 = ChannelTypeFeatures::only_static_remote_key() (bit 12 set)
