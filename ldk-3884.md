# Update fee and dust handling for zero fee channels

## Runthrough 1

Goals:
- Self review of code
- Check where we'll change things for `TxBuilder` rebase
- Note places where tests can be added

Items with [ ] need to be addressed on next pass / rebase. If they have
and [x] then they've been resolved.

### ln/refactor: add utility to get commitment feerate by channel type

- Moves all commitment feerate calculations into one place
- No logical changes

`TxBuilder`?
- After the first PR, we still have some inline checks to get the
  feerate based on the channel type
- We also have a `get_commitment_feerate` function which checks for
  any pending fee updates

[ ] Q: Could this refactor be combined with `get_commitment_feerate`?
- These seem to have slightly different uses, one is for

### ln: return Option for dust_exposure_limiting_feerate

- `get_dust_exposure_limiting_feerate` doesn't really make sense for
  zero fee commitments - dust doesn't contribute to fees
- `get_max_dust_htlc_exposure_msat` defaults to 1sat/vbyte if `None`
  is provided

Q: What defenses do we have against `get_max_dust_htlc_exposure_msat`
  accidentally being called with `None` for a channel that actually
  has fee-dependent dust?
- We've got a check that if we're zero fee then we're none, but not
  the reverse (if we're none, we must be zero fee)

[x] Update assert to match in both directions (this should actually
    happen in the next commit), moved the assert to next one.

### ln: add channel type awareness to get_dust_exposure_limiting_feerate

- Pass channel type into dust exposure so that zero fee commitments
  can return a `None` value
- `excess_feerate_opt` should always be `Some(0)` for zero fee comms

[ ] Q: do we want to implicitly go through all this logic assuming
    that we'll pop out with a zero value for zero fee commitments or
    do we just want to return early?

### ln: remove unnecessary nonzero anchor channel check in build_htlc_output

- Removes an unnecessary check from `build_htlc_output`, we check that
  a channel isn't _both_ nonzero anchors and zero anchors; but we never
  define any channel types that are both of these so they're redundant.

### ln/refactor: move success/timeout dust limits into helper

- Pulls dust calculations out into their own function
[x] Need to move function into `chan_utils.rs`

### ln: set zero second stage fees for zero fee commitments

### ln: return early and assert in fee calculation and checks

- Adds zero returns for next commitment feerate and stale fee checks

### ln: do not send and reject receive of update_fee for zero fee commits

- Never return true for fee updates for zero fee commitment channels

### ln: do not maintain fee spike buffer for zero fee commitment channels

- Question about whether to assert - Matt thinks its fine

## Summary:

`TxBuilder`:
- Nothing really needs to fundamentally change.
- Most of the refactors are complimentary, perhaps just fewer LOC.

`Tests`:
- [x] Don't reserve a fee spike buffer for a zero fee channel 
- [ ] Commitment fees are actually chosen to be zero
- [ ] We don't close them due to stale feerates
- [ ] A test that covers zero fee second stage commitments not impacting
      dust/commit affordablility (piggybacked on anchor channels if
      possible).
- [ ] Coverage that we don't actually set any excess feerate on a zero
      feerate commitment (?)

Check:
- [x] Look at the rename fixup commit I did and squash it
- [x] Pre-existing check that `next_local_commit_tx_fee_msat` and
      `next_remote_commit_tx_fee_msat` are using the correct dust
      limits - they're using either holder or counterparty for both
      success and timeout (channel / 4982 + 5091)
      -> Yes, these are only for the counterparty/local so it makes
         sense to only use one person's dust limit

## Rebase Notes

Conflict 1:
- This PR has pulled commitment calculation out into its own function
- Main has split up anchors and commitment fee rate into separate
  items because anchors are now included in `TxBuilder`

Conflict 2:
- The function that previously returned htlc fees *and* commit fee
  was broken up to just return fees for htlcs
- More conflicts for places where we pulled out anchors, and around
  dust values

Conflict 3:
- From previous rebases, moved the real_dust_limit_{timeout/success}
  down in `get_available_balances_for_scope`

# Test notes

Trying to write a test that hits the fee spike buffer. This is a 
challenge because LDK will never send something (or forward it) if it
hits this buffer (because LDK works as it should).

For this reason, we have to _manually_ send a HTLC that we otherwise
would not accept. Given our current test utils, we also have to manually
send the commitment!

We have a test that does this, but it's not creating zero fee commitment
transactions correctly!
- The main issue is the manual crafting of the commitment transaction:
  - Created in the test using `CommitmentTransaction::new()`
  - Validated in the test using `build_commitment_transaction`

How to debug this?

Q: Are they being passed the same parameters?

In the test, we include the HTLC in our commitment:
```
CKC: CommitmentTransaction::new parameters in test:
  to_broadcaster_value_sat: 95000
  local_chan_balance: 1313
  feerate_per_kw: 0
  accepted_htlc_info: HTLCOutputInCommitment { offered: false, amount_msat: 3460001, cltv_expiry: 81, payment_hash: 66687aadf862bd776c8fc18b8e9f8e20089714856ee233b3902a591d0d5f2925, transaction_output_index: Some(1) }
```

In validate, we don't have a txout (which makes it dust?)
```
CommitmentTransaction::new parameters in tx_builder:
  to_broadcaster_value_sat: 95000
  to_countersignatory_value_sat: 1539
  feerate_per_kw: 0
  htlcs_in_tx: [HTLCOutputInCommitment { offered: false, amount_msat: 3460001, cltv_expiry: 81, payment_hash: 66687aadf862bd776c8fc18b8e9f8e20089714856ee233b3902a591d0d5f2925, transaction_output_index: None }]
```

The problem was that the test was hardcoding our local balance before
we sub out htlcs, and this will be different for different commitment
types (because we have a zero fee now sometimes).

## Review Response

We currently have:
- A check in channelmanager for when we need to update our fee rate
  - This won't trigger when feerates are the same, except in the zero
    case
- My current approach is to let this check trigger an update, then
  get all the way down to channel where `can_send_fee_update` will
  say no (due to channel type)

Suggestion: instead, have the check in channelmanager just not trigger
for zero fee.
- This isn't too much of a "responsibility leak", because channel 
  manager is just checking a special case of an "unchanged" feerate
- If we have this check, what do we do with the code in channel?
  - Disallow calling it?

In:
- `maybe_update_chan_fees` (tests/fuzzing)
- `timer_tick_occurred`

We will call the `channelmanager`'s:
`update_channel_fee`
  - `queue_update_fee`
    - `send_update_fee`:
      - `can_send_update_fee` checked
      - Put pending update in `pending_update_fee`
- Next time we clear holding cells:
  - This will be dispatched

Do we hit this anywhere else?
- `send_update_fee`?
  - `queue_update_fee` (only called by `update_channel_fee`)
  - `free_holding_cell_htlcs`: this is where we clear it out

`pending_update_fee`:
- We only populate this in `send_update_fee`
- We set it to none in `shutdown`

So what do we do?
- Make the check in `channelmanager`
[x] DBG Assert in `send_update_fee` that we are not zero fee
[x] Do nothing in `can_send_update_fee`?
