# Abstract weight of htlc transactions out of channel

This PR aims to move more of our "commitment related" logic
into `TxBuilder`. Specifically handling of HTLCs / dust concerns.

Right now, there are the following quite specific APIs:
- Success/timeout fees for second stage htlcs
- Total endogenous fees for the transaction

The question is whether we want these, or we can just pass all
our htlcs off to the builder and not worry about it. Specifically,
there are a few places that are pretty concerned with these values.

`get_pending_inbound_htlc_details`:
- Gets a `dust_buffer_feerate`
- Iterates through `pending_inbound_htlcs`:
  - Uses success dust limit + holder to get limit
  - Notes whether the htlc is dust

`get_pending_inbound_htlc_details`:
- Similar to the above, gets the dust limit and sets bool on
  htlcs.

Q: Is this `is_dust` bool used widely?
- This is persisted and publicly exposed
- They're really not used anywhere else
- Functions are only used in `from_channel`
  - Used in various list functions which seem mostly
    aesthetic

`get_available_balances_for_scope`:

If we are outbound:
- We create a candidate htlc that's above dust limit
- We create a candidate htlc that's below the dust limit
- We bump them by a multiplier if we need it 
- `capacity_minut_commitment_fee_msat` = 
  current balance minus the maximum commit fee
  - If this is less than the current dust threshold we can't
    add a non-dust htlc:
    - `capacity_minut_commitment_fee_msat` =
      available - max + max - min
    - Pick smallest value between dust limit and this amt
    - Available capacity is largest between leftover and real
  - Otherwise, we can add a non-dust htlc:
    - Our available capaity is what's in the channel

If we are not outbound:
- We get a htlc that's above the dust limit
- We get the next commit fee
- We cap to the available amount or the dust limit

Right now we pass in a `HTLCCandidate` to our fee calculations
and a `fee_spike_buffer`
