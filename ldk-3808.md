# Add Payer Note to Human Readable

Issue: https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/3780
PR: https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3808

## Background

`ChannelManager::pay_for_offer_from_human_readable_name`
- Does a bip 353 human readable DNS lookup to get the offer
- Accepts:
  - `HumanReadableName`:
    - `[u8]`: strips the prefix used off to just contain user/domain,
      limited to 231 chars (255 - mandatory prefix)
    - `user_len` + `domain_len`: tell us how to break things up
  - Various payment parameters + BOLT 12 retry strategy
  - Provide the DNS resolvers that we want to use

- `resolve_name`: performs the DNSSecQuery to get the offer
- `reply_path = `create_blinded_path`: didn't look at specifics here
- `pending_outbound_payments.add_new_awaiting_offer`:
  - Adds to hashmap uniquely identifying payments
  - `PendingOutboundPayment::AwaitingOffer`:
    - State used for DNS waiting for offer to be resolved
    - Holds all the info that we provided (amt etc)
- TODO: how DNS queries are processed 

Issue proposes:
- Be able to set other offer parameters like `payer_note`

Discussion in Issue:
- Some discussion about including the `quantity` parameter, which was
  included in the spec for a very specific use case (I believe, for a
  POS when you're buying 3 apples for $1 each and you want to be able
  to pay a $3 offer with a quantity of 3 - was unclear to me at the
  time why we needed this tbh).

## PR

- Add `payer_note` option to `pay_for_offer_from_human_readable_name`
  - This is persisted as optional, no migration concerns
- This is propagated through to `PendingOutboundPayment::AwaitingOffer`
- Surfaced in `amt_msats_for_payment_awaiting_offer`, which is renamed
  because it's now a more general fn:
  - This is used in `handle_dnssec_proof`:
    - We lookup the params that we stored in our `pending_outbound_payments`
    - `pay_for_offer_intern`:
      - Already has a `payer_note` option
