# TxBuilder

https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3775

Aim:
- API that supports "fixed additional outputs" on commitments
- For example, anchors

Notes from PR:
- TODO: `commit_and_htlc_tx_fees_sat`

## Remove broadcaster_dust_limit_sat, feerate_per_kw from CommitmentStats

- Previously use `build_commitment_stats` to return stats that would
  be used in `build_commitment_transaction`, including:
  - `feerate_per_kw`:
    - Used to decide whether to trip HTLCs to fees
    - Used as feerate for commitment transaction
  - `broadcaster_dust_limit_sat`:
    - Used to decide whether to trip HTLCs to fees
    - Used to decide whether to trip local/remote for the broadcasting
      party's commitment
- These values are removed from `CommitmentStats`:
  - `get_commitment_feerate` returns `feerate_per_kw`
  - `broadcaster_dust_limit_sat` is just directly obtained in
    `build_commitment_transaction` as it was done in 
    `build_commitment_stats` using:
    - if local = `self.holder_dust_limit_satoshis`
    - if else = `self.counterparty_dust_limit_satoshis`

## Remove total_anchors_sat from CommitmentStats

- Remove/modify more things from `CommitmentStats`:
  - `local_balance_before_fee_anchors_msat`: previously took off fees
    and anchors, now just takes off fees
  - `remote_balance_before_fee_anchors_msat`: previously took off fees
    and anchors, now just takes off fees
  - `total_anchors_sat`: removed entirely
- Subtracting anchors is moved into `build_commitment_stats` when it

### Changes comparison:

Previously:
- `value_to_self_msat` = `funding.value_to_self_msat` + `value_to_self_msat_offset`
  - The offset is the total of pending, claimable HTLCs that will be
    added to our local balance.
- `value_to_self_msat.saturating_sub(local_htlc_total_msat)`
  - The `local_htlc_total_msat` is the total number of pending outgoing
    HTLCs that we're going to add to the commitment (which would
    decrease our balance).
  - This sub can be `unwrap`-ed because we validate elsewhere in the
    codebase that we haven't added HTLCs that we can't accomodate
- We'd report our `value_to_self_msat` like this

In `build_commitment_transaction`:
- We get `CommitmentStats` which give us these values
- We get our local/remote values depending on whether we're outbound,
  ie on whether we're the ones who pay fees:
  - If we pay fees:
    - Local = `local_balance_before_fee_anchors_msat` - `anchors` - `fees`
    - Remote = `remote_balance_before_fee_anchors_msat` / 1000
  - If we don't pay fees:
    - Local = `local_balance_before_fee_anchors_msat` / 1000
    - Remote = `remote_balance_before_fee_anchors_msat` - `anchors` - `fees`
- We then assign these value to `broadcaster/counterparty` based on whose
  commitment we're building
- These values are added if they're above the dust limit for the 
  broadcaster
- They are used finally to build a commitment transaction

Now:
- `value_to_self_msat` = `funding.value_to_self_msat` + `value_to_self_msat_offset`
  - Offset calculation unchanged
- `value_to_self_msat.saturating_sub(local_htlc_total_msat)`
  - Calculation of `local_htlc_total_msat` unchanged
- We subtract anchors based on whether we are outbound, ie, whether
  we're the outbound:
  - If we pay fees:
    - `value_to_self_msat` = `value_to_self_msat` - `anchors`
  - If we don't pay fees:
    - `value_to_remote_msat` = `value_to_remote_msat` - `anchors`
- Return these values in the `CommitmentStats`

In `build_commitment_transaction`:
- We get `CommitmentStats` which give us these values
- We get our local/remote values based on whether we're fee-paying:
  - If we pay fees:
    - Local = `local_balance_before_fee_msat` - fees
    - Remote = `remote_balance_before_fee_msat` /1000
  - If we don't pay fees:
    - Local = `local_balance_before_fee_msat` / 1000
    - Remote = `remote_balance_before_fee_msat` - fees
- We then assign these values to `broadcaster/counterparty` (unchanged)
- These values are added if they're above the dust limit and included
  in the commimtnet transaction as before.

So, TLDR: we're moving the subtraction of anchor values up into the
`build_commitment_stats` method.

Q: Does this change the order that the BOLTs say that we should do things:

Per [Commitment Transaction Construction](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md#commitment-transaction-construction):

1. Initialize the commitment transaction input and locktime, as specified
1. Calculate which committed HTLCs need to be trimmed.
2. Calculate the base commitment transaction fee.
4. For every offered HTLC, if it is not trimmed, add an offered HTLC output
5. For every received HTLC, if it is not trimmed, add a received HTLC output.
6. If the `to_local` amount is greater or equal to `dust_limit_satoshis`, add a to_local
7. If the `to_remote` amount is greater or equal to `dust_limit_satoshis`, add a to_remote
8. If `option_anchors` applies to the commitment transaction:
  * if `to_local` exists or there are untrimmed HTLCs, add a `to_local_anchor` output
  * if `to_remote` exists or there are untrimmed HTLCs, add a `to_remote_anchor` output
9. Sort the outputs into BIP 69+CLTV order.

This kinda looks pre-existing wrong to me, by the way that I read this
you should get your local, check whether it's dust and _then_ only
subtract anchors off if you need it.

Q: Where does LDK re-add the balance that we've subtracted if we don't
   need both anchors?
- `insert_non_htlc_outputs` is responsible for adding anchors (if there
  are HTLCs or a local/remote).
- We don't give the balance back, confirmed with a test on anchor-tests
  branch

Going to check what LND does to make sure this is sane:
- Looking at `SignNextCommitment`:
  - `fetchHTLCView`: returns all HTLCs pending
  - `fetchCommitmentView`:
    - `compute_view`:
      - Get current balance for local/remote
      - `evaluateHTLCView`:
        - Calculates the difference to balances that HTLCs will have
        - Does not subtract anchors from balance
      - Subtract HTLC values from local/remote values
      - Counts all non-dust HTLCs towards weight
  - `createUnsignedCommitmentTx`:
    - Get the dust limit for the right part
    - Collect all the offered/received HTLCs in our updates
    - Get the weight and fee for the commitment
    - If we pay fees:
      - Saturating sub fees from our balance
    - If they pay fees:
      - Saturating sub fees from their balance
    - They do some funny aux stuff for custom LND chanz
    - `CreateCommitmentTx`:
      - Some more funny aux channel stuff
      - If local output >= dust limit of holder:
        - Trim it
      - If remote output >= dust limit of holder:
        - Trim it
      - Add the outputs if they exist (non-zero)
      - If anchors:
        - Adds anchors if localOutput || numHTLCs > 0

Q: It is impossible that anchors are not being subtracted off of these
   balances - all commitments evar would be 660 sat short. So I must
   be missing it. The important part is whether it happens before or
   after dust checks.

Final outcome: the spec indicates that you could subtract both anchors
even if you're only using one.

## Remove total_anchors_sat from CommitmentStats (second look)

Previously:
- We would include the anchor amount in `CommitmentStats`
- They would be removed in `build_commitment_transaction`
- `update_fee` checks would add anchors to check

Now:
- We subtract the anchor amount in `CommitmentStats`
- `update_fee` anchors are already accounted for

There's no change to subtracting this value early, because it was
always being subtracted off.

## Add TxBuilder::build_commitment_stats

- Changes `commit_and_htlc_tx_fees_sat` to just be `htlc_tx_fees_sat`
- Calculates `commit_fee` in `TxBuilder`

`validate_update_add_htlc`
- Previously:
  - Calculate total amount of HTLCs removed from outbound
  - `pending_value_to_self_msat` = 
      `funding.value_to_self_msat` + 
      `htlc_stats.pending_inbound_htlcs_value_msat` -
      `removed_outbound_total_msat`
  - `pending_remote_value_msat` = 
      `funding.get_value_satoshis() * 1000` -
      `pending_value_to_self_msat`
  - Get amount of anchors based on channel type
  - Get `next_local_commit_tx_fee_msat(funding, htlc_candidate, None)
  - Check `funding.value_to_self_msat` < 
    `funding.counterparty_selected_channel_reserve_satoshis * 1000` +
    `local_commit_tx_fee_msat` +
    `anchor_output_value_msat`

- Now:
  - Calculate the amount of HTLC removed from outbound
  - Count the number of non-dust HTLCs removed
  - Values to self are the same!
  - Performs check using `local_balance_before_fee_msat` (which includes
    anchors) against reseerve
    Q: Is this the same? Yes, we're just subbing off anchors early

Need to resume on `can_send_update_fee`

Q: perhaps add common prefactor? If the hltc fee stuff is touched
a lot?
