# Enforce Trampoline Constraints

## Address Review Round 1

Tests aren't very readable. Indeed (woof).

What are the dimensions we're working with?
- Blinded vs unblinded
- Success vs force a failure

(would also want to introduce a trampoline forward)

What can we pull out into a test case?
- Provide us with the route you want to test
- Provide us with a switch out onion (if you need one)
- Provide us with the failure (or success) you expect

What makes this difficult to understand?
- We have different blinded tails that are difficult to follow.
- We have to switch out the onion, which is confusing (I think that we
  have to live with this, because we can't otherwise create the things
  that we want to test).
