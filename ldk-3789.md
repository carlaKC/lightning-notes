# V3 On Chain PR

Final PR in the V3 series, which will deal with commitment format and
on-chain processing.

Q: where in the codebase do we set sighash?
- We use the same sighash for regular anchors, so anywhere that we
  check the anchors type, we can just check the zero fee type
  when we already set Single|ACP
  - `build_htlc_input_witness`
  - `validate_commitment_signed`
  - `sign_counterparty_commitment`
  - `sign_holder_htlc_transaction` 

Q: where do we set sequence and second stage transactions?

Q: How do we submit packages?
